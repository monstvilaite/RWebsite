      <description>Rotavirus is a childhood disease and the leading cause of severe diarrhea in children aged less than five years. This infection is associated with significant mortality in developing countries and high financial burdens worldwide. The incubation time of rotavirus is around 2 days while severe symptoms last for approximately 4-8 days (“Rotavirus | About Rotavirus | CDC” 2015). The median age at the primary rotavirus infection ranges from six to nine months in low income countries, while in high income countries the first episode may occasionally be delayed until the age of two to five years; the majority of incidences however, still occurs in infancy.</description>
